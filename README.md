# AI-RAG-FINE-TUNED_Pipelines
Please note This Repo Contains RAG and Fine-Tuned based AI Models to be presented as POC to upper management.
Goal-
Build a ** RAG or/and fine-tuned LLM-based automation system** that:
- Accepts **HLDs in PDF/PPT** format uploaded via a **web portal**.
- Generates **LLD configurations** in:
  - CLI format (for Cisco NX-OS, IOS-XR, IOS-XE, Catalyst, ASA, Juniper SRX, F5 LB)
  - Text format (for GUI-based manual steps)
- Performs **pre-checks** and **validation** of configs.
- Optionally **pushes configs to devices** after manual approval.


We are planning AI based where Network based LLD Network configs will be produced from High-level designs of DC Networks.

As a training dataset, we gonna use already implemented HLD/LLD pairs.

Tested RAG based system first, seems its accuracy gonna be less.
Fine-tuned based POC is underway, and its seems to be promosing.
